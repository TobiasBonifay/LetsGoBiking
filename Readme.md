# LetsGoBiking
## How to start

<p>Launch both .exe, Proxy and Router services</p>
<p>Launch activemq on a terminal</p>
<p>Finally, start the Main java class of the FrontEnd section</p>


## About our work

<p>BackEnd contains the routing server, which is the logic of our solution, and the proxy server, which is used to communicate with the JCDecaux API and store responses in the cache</p>
<p>FrontEnd contains a Java-client that allows you to communicate with the Routing Server to receive routing instructions </p>

<p>Executables contains the same BackEnd's solutions but selfhosted </p>
